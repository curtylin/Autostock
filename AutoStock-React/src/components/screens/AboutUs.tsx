            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Autostock is an algo trading platform that will allow users to have a more simplified experience when trading algorithmically. 
                Users are able to backtest their strategies on previous data, as well as test it in a real world trading environment. 
                One of the main features of our platform is to provide the “gamification” of algo-trading by having a leaderboard based system 
                where users can go head to head and test/compare their strategies.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>We are currently in our final year of completion of the Computer Science B.S. Program at the University of Utah. This is our senior capstone project. We hope you like it, we do.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our goal is to create a new trading platform targeted towards quantitative analysts, programmers, trading hobbyists, and anyone willing to learn. 
                We want to simplify/gamify while teaching the key concepts of trading without having the user have to commit their hard earned money. 
                This can be done through simulations to compare a user’s own strategies with known strategies/our strategies/their friend’s strategies. 
                In our finished product, we want to create a platform that  creates a blend between both a simulation and real life trading platform.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h4>Front End</h4>
            
            <p>With Autostock, I focused on the front end of the project. For my personal feature, the discussion boards, I was able to dip my toes into the back end. For me, this project has 
                given me the opportunity to work closely with a team on new skills that I have found to enjoy. I also enjoy learning new skills outside of class like cooking and playing the guitar, even though 
                I am not very good at either. </p>

            <h4>Full Stack</h4>
            <p>I am proud to have joined Autostock for the capstone project as the guy for full stack engineering. For this project, I did everything relating to the database including competitions, algorithms, and users. For my rank 3, I realized there was a need for bots for each competition to boost the competitiveness. This is my first time working on React and I am proud of what I have done. 
                In my freetime, I love experiencing new flavors and places. I also take plenty of pictures to document all of my experiences.
