            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Autostock is an algo trading platform that will allow users to have a more simplified experience when trading algorithmically. 
                Users are able to backtest their strategies on previous data, as well as test it in a real world trading environment. 
                One of the main features of our platform is to provide the “gamification” of algo-trading by having a leaderboard based system 
                where users can go head to head and test/compare their strategies.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>We are currently in our final year of completion of the Computer Science B.S. Program at the University of Utah. This is our senior capstone project. We hope you like it, we do.</p>
            <br></br>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our goal is to create a new trading platform targeted towards quantitative analysts, programmers, trading hobbyists, and anyone willing to learn. 
                We want to simplify/gamify while teaching the key concepts of trading without having the user have to commit their hard earned money. 
                This can be done through simulations to compare a user’s own strategies with known strategies/our strategies/their friend’s strategies. 
                In our finished product, we want to create a platform that  creates a blend between both a simulation and real life trading platform.</p>
