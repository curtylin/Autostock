      <h2>1. Create an algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        You can get started by{" "}

      <h2>2. Backtest your algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        Be sure to backtest your algorithm against historical data. Here is
        where you can see if some parts of the algorithm needs to be changed for
        a better yield.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Save your algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have saved your algorithm, remember to save it and your
        algorithm will be available for you to see in the "
        <Link to="/app/myalgorithm">My Algorithms</Link>" page. Here, you can
        edit, share, and delete your algorithm. <br></br>
        <br></br> Please note: There will only be a day gain IF and only if you
        have submitted your algorithm to an active competition. Otherwise,
        please use the backtest function in the edit algorithm page.

      <h2>4. View other people's algorithms for inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Once your algorithm is shared with the world, and it can be viewed under
        the "<Link to="/app/publicalgorithms">Public Algorithms</Link>" page.

      <br></br>

      <h2>5. Enter your algorithm into a competition</h2>
      <p>
        Once you are happy with your algorithm, you can also enter it into a
        competition that you are interested in. You can do this by going to the
        "<Link to="/app/competition">Competitions</Link>" page. Make sure you
        submit your algorithm before the closing date of the competition. You
        are able to change the algorithm you submit anytime until the closing
        date.

        Note: Make sure your algorithm's ticker is the same as the ticker of the
        competition.
