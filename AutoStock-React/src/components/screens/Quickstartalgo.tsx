            <h1>I want to create an algorithm... where should I start?</h1>
            <br></br>

            <h2>1. Name your algorithm</h2>
            <p>We recommend naming it something with your name, ticker, and indicator with it. </p>
            {/* <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYtuZIC.gif"></img> */}
            <br></br>

            <h2>2. Pick a stock ticker you would want to test your algorithm on.</h2>
            <p>We recommend taking look at the <Link to="/app/competitions">upcoming competitions</Link> to maximize your winnings by using a ticker you'd actually compete in.</p>
            {/* <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYtuZIC.gif"></img> */}
            <br></br>

            <h2>3. Pick a time interval you'd want your algorithm to run for.</h2>
            <p>For example, a "1 Hour" interval means that your algorithm would check every hour to check the comparators.</p>
            {/* <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYtuZIC.gif"></img> */}
            <br></br>

            <h2>4. Pick an indicator that would maximize the yield on your algorithm.</h2>
            <p>
                Now we must start with the entry portion of the strategy or rules that signal when to buy or sell. 

                Indicators are technical strategies that are built into most algotrading API's that initiate trades based off different trends. Picking your indicator is very vital to ensuring your algotrading strategy is successful which
                is why we recommend backtesting, looking at different trends and doing your research. 

                Below are some links to some basic indicators.  
                <Link to="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp">SMA, or Simple moving average</Link> is the most basic indicator you can have. It essentially calculates the average of a selected range.
                <br></br>
                <Link to="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp">ADX, or Average Directional Index Rating</Link> is a more advanced indicator that can be used to determine if the market is trending up or down.
                <br></br>
                
            </p>

            <br></br>

            <h2>4. Select the Period 1.</h2>
            <p></p>

                While different indicators take in different inputs, the most common indicators belong to the moving average family. Moving averages take in an input
                known as periods. The smaller the period the more sensative it will be to price changes. 
                For Moving Averages a period will average the prices for the input period ammount and add the price on the previous day. 

                While periods are common for many algotrading strategies they will change in more complicated strategies.

                It is recommend to play arround with periods respect to moving averages.

            <br></br>

            <h2>5. Select the Indicator 2/Comparator.</h2>
            <p></p>

                Next portion of the entry is to give it another indicator or strategy to compare to. This will determine the different entry rules on when to buy and sell
            {/* <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYtuZIC.gif"></img> */}
            <br></br>

            <h2>6. Select the Period 2.</h2>
            <p></p>
                Similar to period 1, Period 2 works as the period for the second indicator to complete the entry rules.

            <br></br>

            <h2>7. Select Buy or Sell.</h2>
            <p></p>
            {/* <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYtuZIC.gif"></img> */}
                You are given an action that will perform when the conditions that are meant in the Entry/Entries are met.

            <h2>8. Select the algorithm running time.</h2>
            <p></p>

                This will determine how long your algorithm will run for. Strategies especially indicators will be more effective depending on the length ran for. 
            {/* <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYtuZIC.gif"></img> */}
            <br></br>

            <h2>9. Add additional paramters.</h2>
            <p></p>
                You may chainlink different entries together in order to form a new strategy. This is not recommended for beginners and we recommend playing arround with one
                entry first, but is encouraged for more advanced users.

            <h2>10. When you are somewhat happy with your algorithm, Backtest!</h2>
            <p>You don't have to fully be satisfied with the algorithm at this point. Backtest your algorithm on historical data to see how well it would've done. Afterwards, you can repeat steps 2-10 until you feel like you are satisfied. Not only will it tell you how much money your algorithm would've made, it also tells you where your buy/sell orders were executed by the algorithm. </p>

            <br></br>

            <h2>11. Save your algorithm</h2>
            <p>After you have backtested and feel your algorithm is ready, make sure to save your algorithm! This would allow you to enter your algorithm into a competition!</p>
