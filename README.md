# Running on Docker: (Easiest solution, NOTE: These are all run on WSL/Linux.. make sure you have docker preinstalled there.)
To build a docker image run the following command: (keep in mind, this will take a while to load ~5 minutes.. so we recommend running it on development.)
```
docker build -f Dockerfile.SingleCombined -t autostock-react .
```

To run the docker image run 
```
docker run --rm -p 80:80 autostock-react 
```
Which will run on http://localhost/ from there you can see the application running

# Alternatively you can set up the project and run from there
## To first get started with the project:
## In one terminal, To get the backend packages installed and running: 
### Make sure you have at least python 3.8.10 installed on your machine.

Go to this directory 
`/auto-stock/AutoStock-React/api`
and then run 
`python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment (only need to do this once) 
following which you can run 
`. venv/bin/activate`
afterwards you install all the dependencies by running 
`pip install -U pip` and then
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

Once all of that is done, run this command in the terminal:
`npm run start-api` to run the flask backend

## Then in another terminal, to get the frontend packages installed and running: 
run the following code in the WSL terminal (MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE auto-stock DIRECTORY !! VERY IMPORTANT)
navigate to `/auto-stock/AutoStock-React`

and then run `npm install` to install the necessary packages. 

to start a session navigate to the autostock-react directory and run the command 
`npm run start` to start up the project
which will usually have it run on `localhost:8000`



# Troubleshooting
## No Gatsby
If the following causes you troubles in the WSL terminal:

`npm install` usually fixes most of them, or you need to delete node_modules and redo that command. 


# Building project
To build a project run 
`npm build`
